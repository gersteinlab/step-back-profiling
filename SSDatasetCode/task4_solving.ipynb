Our findings suggest that VBSE can provide a more effective and efficient way to develop software that meets the needs of stakeholders and delivers value to the organization.\n97 Value-Based Software Engineering (VBSE) is a promising approach to software development that emphasizes the creation of value for stakeholders. In this paper, we present a case study that demonstrates how VBSE can be integrated into current and emerging software engineering principles and practices. We also show how traditional project feedback control mechanisms fail to address the project's actual value in the context of rapidly changing IT field. Finally, we discuss how a value-based approach to software development can prevent the wasteful misuse of an organization's resources. Our findings suggest that VBSE can help organizations achieve better outcomes by focusing on value creation rather than simply meeting project requirements.\n98 This paper explores the use of benchmarking in software engineering research as a means to promote technical progress and community building within the discipline. We examine how the software engineering research community can become more scientific and cohesive through the definition and use of benchmarks. Additionally, we investigate the impacts and outcomes of using benchmarks in the reverse engineering community and how these findings can be applied to advance the state of research in software engineering. Our analysis suggests that benchmarking can be a powerful tool for advancing research and fostering collaboration within the software engineering community. We conclude with a challenge to the community to embrace benchmarking as a means to accelerate progress and promote scientific rigor in software engineering research.\n98 This paper explores the potential benefits of using benchmarks in software engineering research. Through an analysis of existing literature and case studies, we address three key research questions: how benchmarks can contribute to technical progress and community building, how they can promote scientific rigor and cohesion within the research community, and what impacts they have on the reverse engineering community. Our findings suggest that the use of benchmarks can lead to significant advancements in software engineering research, and we propose several recommendations for their implementation and adoption.\n98 This paper proposes the use of benchmarking as a means to advance research and promote community building within the software engineering discipline. We address three research questions: 1) How can benchmarks contribute to rapid technical progress and community building? 2) How can the software engineering research community become more scientific and cohesive through benchmarking? 3) What are the impacts and outcomes of using benchmarks in reverse engineering, and how can these findings be applied to advance software engineering research? By answering these questions, we aim to provide a framework for the use of benchmarks in software engineering research and promote a more scientific and collaborative approach to advancing the field.\n99 The field of software engineering is constantly evolving, presenting unique challenges for education. This paper addresses three research questions: 1) What are the essential technical skills for a software engineer? 2) What are the commonalities and specific issues in software engineering compared to other engineering fields? 3) How can education emphasize principles and recognize stable design concepts in a continuously evolving field? By exploring these questions, this paper aims to provide insights into the challenges of software engineering education and potential solutions to address them.\n99 In this paper, we address the challenges of software engineering education by exploring the essential technical skills that a software engineer should possess. We also examine the common aspects that crosscut all engineering fields and the specific issues that pertain to software engineering. Finally, we propose ways in which education can emphasize principles and recognize stable and long-lasting design concepts in a continuously evolving field like software engineering. Our findings provide insights into the necessary skills and knowledge that software engineers need to succeed in their profession.\n"
